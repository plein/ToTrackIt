# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The local-only Process API is the core foundation of ToTrackIt, providing essential endpoints to manage asynchronous process tracking. This API enables users to start processes with unique identifiers, track their progress, mark completion, retrieve individual process details, list processes with filtering capabilities, and query metrics for analysis. The API operates entirely in-memory for Phase 0, focusing on core functionality without external dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with ToTrackIt, I want to start tracking a new process, so that I can monitor its lifecycle and ensure it completes within expected timeframes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /processes THEN the system SHALL create a new process with a unique identifier
2. WHEN creating a process THEN the system SHALL accept a process name, optional deadline, and optional metadata tags
3. WHEN a process is created THEN the system SHALL return the process ID, creation timestamp, and initial status
4. WHEN no deadline is provided THEN the system SHALL create the process without deadline constraints
5. IF invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring processes, I want to mark a process as complete, so that I can track successful completion and measure actual duration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT request is made to /processes/{id}/complete THEN the system SHALL mark the process as completed
2. WHEN completing a process THEN the system SHALL record the completion timestamp
3. WHEN completing a process THEN the system SHALL calculate and store the total duration
4. IF the process ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
5. IF the process is already completed THEN the system SHALL return a 409 conflict error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want to retrieve detailed information about a specific process, so that I can understand its current state and history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /processes/{id} THEN the system SHALL return complete process details
2. WHEN retrieving a process THEN the system SHALL include ID, name, status, creation time, completion time (if applicable), deadline (if set), duration, and metadata
3. IF the process ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
4. WHEN the process is incomplete THEN the system SHALL indicate if it's overdue based on deadline

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want to list and filter processes, so that I can monitor overall system health and identify problematic processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /processes THEN the system SHALL return a paginated list of processes
2. WHEN listing processes THEN the system SHALL support filtering by status (running, completed, overdue)
3. WHEN listing processes THEN the system SHALL support filtering by tags using query parameters
4. WHEN listing processes THEN the system SHALL support pagination with limit and offset parameters
5. WHEN no filters are applied THEN the system SHALL return all processes ordered by creation time (newest first)
6. WHEN filtering by overdue THEN the system SHALL only return running processes past their deadline

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team lead analyzing performance, I want to query process metrics, so that I can understand completion rates, average durations, and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /processes/metrics THEN the system SHALL return aggregated process statistics
2. WHEN querying metrics THEN the system SHALL include total process count, completed count, running count, and overdue count
3. WHEN querying metrics THEN the system SHALL include average completion duration for completed processes
4. WHEN querying metrics THEN the system SHALL support filtering metrics by tags using query parameters
5. WHEN querying metrics THEN the system SHALL include percentile data (50th, 90th, 95th) for completion durations
6. IF no processes match the filter criteria THEN the system SHALL return zero values for all metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to handle errors gracefully, so that integrating applications receive clear feedback about issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid JSON is sent THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with error details
2. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with field validation errors
3. WHEN a resource is not found THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found with appropriate message
4. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return a 500 Internal Server Error with generic error message
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a 429 Too Many Requests response

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working locally, I want the API to run entirely in-memory, so that I can develop and test without external database dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize in-memory storage for processes
2. WHEN the application stops THEN the system SHALL not persist any data to disk
3. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL start with empty process storage
4. WHEN storing processes THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency within the application lifecycle
5. WHEN concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle thread safety for in-memory operations
