# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Docker setup to make ToTrackIt more accessible and production-ready for open source adoption. While the current Docker configuration works well, this enhancement focuses on improving the developer experience, adding production-ready features, and ensuring the service can be easily run by anyone in the open source community with minimal setup friction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new open source contributor, I want to get ToTrackIt running locally with a single command, so that I can quickly start contributing without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `docker-compose up` THEN the system SHALL start all services and be ready for API calls within 2 minutes
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically run database migrations without manual intervention
3. WHEN services are starting THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators and health status
4. IF any service fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive health checks and monitoring, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for all components
2. WHEN a service becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL automatically restart the service
3. WHEN viewing service status THEN the system SHALL show detailed health information including database connectivity and application readiness
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging with appropriate log levels

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want production-ready Docker configurations, so that I can deploy ToTrackIt in various environments with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Docker images THEN the system SHALL support multi-architecture builds (AMD64 and ARM64)
2. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL use non-root users and follow security best practices
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations through environment variables
4. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with proper resource limits and requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an open source user, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can understand how to run, configure, and troubleshoot ToTrackIt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading documentation THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step setup instructions for different use cases
2. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL provide a troubleshooting guide with common problems and solutions
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL provide example configurations for development, testing, and production
4. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL provide working examples that can be copy-pasted

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible development workflows, so that I can choose between full Docker development or hybrid approaches based on my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL support running only the database in Docker while running the application natively
2. WHEN making code changes THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading for faster development cycles
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide isolated test environments that don't interfere with development data
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL support attaching debuggers to containerized applications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want observability and monitoring capabilities, so that I can monitor ToTrackIt in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus metrics for monitoring
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide structured logs that can be ingested by log aggregation systems
3. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL provide detailed health check endpoints with dependency status
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide request tracing and correlation IDs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want secure default configurations, so that I can run ToTrackIt without introducing security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running containers THEN the system SHALL use non-root users by default
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use secure default passwords that can be easily changed
3. WHEN exposing services THEN the system SHALL only expose necessary ports and endpoints
4. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL support external secret management systems
