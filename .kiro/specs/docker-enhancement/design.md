# Design Document

## Overview

This design enhances the existing Docker setup for ToTrackIt to provide a world-class open source experience. The enhancement focuses on developer experience, production readiness, security, and observability while maintaining the simplicity that makes open source projects accessible.

The design builds upon the existing solid foundation (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and validation scripts) and adds enterprise-grade features that are essential for production deployments and contributor onboarding.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis

The existing Docker setup includes:
- Multi-stage Dockerfile with Java 21 and Gradle
- Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, application, and Swagger UI
- Health checks and proper networking
- Validation and testing scripts

### Enhanced Architecture

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Enhanced Docker Compose Configuration

**Purpose**: Provide multiple compose files for different use cases

**Components**:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Full development environment
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Database-only for hybrid development
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production-ready configuration
- `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` - Observability stack

**Key Features**:
- Environment-specific overrides
- Resource limits and requests
- Proper dependency management
- Volume management for persistence

### 2. Multi-Architecture Docker Images

**Purpose**: Support both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures for broad compatibility

**Implementation**:
- Use Docker Buildx for multi-platform builds
- Optimize base images for each architecture
- Automated builds via GitHub Actions
- Registry publishing with proper tagging

### 3. Enhanced Health Checks

**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive health monitoring for all services

**Health Check Endpoints**:
- `/health` - Basic application health
- `/health/ready` - Readiness probe (includes DB connectivity)
- `/health/live` - Liveness probe (application responsiveness)
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics endpoint

**Database Health**:
- Connection pool status
- Migration status verification
- Query performance metrics

### 4. Security Hardening

**Purpose**: Implement security best practices for container deployment

**Security Features**:
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base images (distroless for production)
- Secret management integration
- Network security policies
- Resource constraints

### 5. Observability Stack

**Purpose**: Provide monitoring and logging capabilities

**Components**:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Structured JSON logging
- Request tracing with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics dashboard

### 6. Developer Experience Tools

**Purpose**: Streamline development workflows

**Tools**:
- Quick start scripts (`./scripts/quick-start.sh`)
- Development mode with hot reload
- Debug configuration for IDEs
- Test data seeding scripts
- Database migration tools

## Data Models

### Configuration Management

```yaml
# Environment Variables Schema
TOTRACKIT_ENV: [development|production|test]
TOTRACKIT_LOG_LEVEL: [DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR]
TOTRACKIT_DB_HOST: string
TOTRACKIT_DB_PORT: number
TOTRACKIT_DB_NAME: string
TOTRACKIT_DB_USER: string
TOTRACKIT_DB_PASSWORD: string (secret)
TOTRACKIT_METRICS_ENABLED: boolean
TOTRACKIT_TRACING_ENABLED: boolean
```

### Health Check Response Model

```json
{
  "status": "UP|DOWN|DEGRADED",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "components": {
    "database": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "connectionPool": "healthy",
        "migrations": "up-to-date",
